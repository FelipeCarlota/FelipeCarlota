# Felipe Carlota

## Hi, there! :wave:

A developer in constant learning, curious and always seeking to learn new technologies, testing algorithms, or learning from other developers' code.

Additionally, I am a musician, and my favorite instrument is the bass guitar. I believe that music is a practical example that to effectively learn something, you must train both your muscles and your mind.

Whenever I revisit the same piece of music more than once, I notice that I learn different things than I did before, and in the same way, this happens with anything we are willing to learn, including programming.
